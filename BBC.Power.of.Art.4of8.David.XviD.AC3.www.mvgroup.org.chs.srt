1
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:20,806
A funeral cortége clatters its way
through the cobbled streets of Brussels.
殡仪队嗒嗒地通过布鲁塞尔的鹅卵石街道

2
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:24,165
Inside the carriage is the body
殡仪车里，躺着有史以来最有影响力的


3
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:27,762
of the most powerful French painter
there had ever been.
法国画家，雅克路易大卫

4
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:30,525
Jacques-Louis David.
的遗体。

5
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:41,880
Following the carriage
is a solemn procession of art students,
艺术生们肃穆地跟随在殡仪车后面，手举招牌，


6
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:45,880
holding up placards
with the names of his paintings.
上书这位画家的平生作品名称。

7
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:54,445
All but one, which happened to be
the greatest of them all.
但是，刚好是最杰出的一副，却偏偏未在其中。


8
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:59,758
It was a picture which hadn't seen
the light of day for 30 years.
尘封三十年期间

9
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:04,045
No one, least of all the man who painted it,
dared show it.
包括画家本人在内，没人敢于展示它。

10
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:13,604
No wonder. It was the most spellbinding thing
he had ever made.
也不奇怪。这是大卫最富魔力的作品，

11
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:18,524
A painting before which people had once swooned.
人们在它面前激动晕厥

12
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:23,117
A painting both beautiful and repulsive.
它美丽动人而又惹人厌恶

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,523
But the picture was also a guilty secret,
但这副画作还是一个罪恶的秘密，

14
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:35,283
the real reason why David's body
was refused burial in France.
它才是大卫的遗体被拒绝葬在法国的原因。

15
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,880
So, what was it about this painting
那么，究竟是什么使这幅画

16
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:46,486
which made it both his unforgettable 
masterpiece and his unforgivable crime?
成为大卫难以忘怀的经典，
同时又是他无可原谅的罪恶？

17
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:26,084
On the 19th September, 1783,
1783年9月19日，

18
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:31,125
an enormous taffeta spheroid
wobbled its way unsteadily
一个巨大的塔夫绸气球摇摇晃晃地

19
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:33,482
above the palace of Versailles.
升上凡尔赛宫上空。

20
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:39,240
In the basket were a sheep, a duck and a rooster.
气球篮子里，装着一只羊，
一只鸭子和一只公鸡。

21
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:45,396
When a violent gust of wind made a tear
near the top of the balloon,
一阵猛风吹来，扯破了气球顶部，

22
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:48,524
there were fears for the barnyard aeronauts.
人们不禁为农庄飞行员感到担心

23
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:55,522
In the end, though, the balloon survived
and it was judged the animals had not suffered.
好在，气球最终幸存下来，动物们有惊无险。

24
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:03,437
This was, though, a major breach of protocol.
但是，此事打破常规：

25
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:07,323
Versailles had been built to control spectacle.
凡尔赛宫就是为了控制奇观而建，

26
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:11,595
That way, the mystery of absolutism
was preserved.
非如此无以保持专制的神秘。

27
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:20,882
On the ground, it was still, to some extent,
an aristocratic vision.
表面上，凡尔赛在一定程度上仍然是一派贵族景象

28
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:25,564
In the air, it'd become democratic.
但是空气里弥漫着民主的气息。

29
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:34,320
In Paris, a more down-to-earth thrill.
而在巴黎，有一种更加世俗的狂欢

30
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:44,123
Beaumarchais'play, The Marriage of Figaro,
is about to open after several government bans.
博马舍的喜剧，费加罗的婚礼，
在多次被禁之后，要开演了。

31
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:51,685
The king had called it detestable.
That guaranteed a crowd.
国王说这出戏可鄙可恨。这票房就有了保障了。

32
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:55,921
No, monsieur.
>> 不不，大人，

33
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,801
Because you are a great lord,
you think you're a great genius?
>> 就因为你是大老爷，你就该是一个大天才？

34
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,847
Nobility, rank,
>> 爵位，品衔，

35
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:08,239
position, fortune,
how proud they make a man feel.
>> 职级，财富，
>> 它们让人何其得意

36
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:11,719
What have you done to deserve such advantages?
>> 你有何德能配得如此眷顾？

37
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:17,523
Put yourself to the trouble of being born,
nothing more. For the rest...
>> 无非是投对了胎，除此之外，

38
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:21,563
...you're a very ordinary man.
>> 你不过就是个普通人

39
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:33,523
There were no signs
that the bravos died on the lips of the nobility,
即使在贵族圈子里，赞美也一点不少，

40
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:38,078
even as they began to realise
the significance of the attack.
即使他们开始意识到这种攻击的严重性

41
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,481
Talk about signing your own death warrant.
要说这就叫自掘坟墓的话

42
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,559
But then, how were they to know that,
in under 10 years,
那谁又能料到，不到十年

43
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:50,118
they'd be on the receiving end
of something far more wounding than words.
贵族们将领教远比言辞更具伤害性的攻击呢

44
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,681
Look, citizens,
>> 看吧，公民们

45
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:57,958
at the glorious destiny that awaits us.
>> 光荣的使命等待着我们

46
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:02,957
You have a whole nation to mobilise.
>> 整个民族等着我们去动员

47
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:04,916
No more...
>> 不再……

48
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:08,283
Still, the French Revolution
could never have happened
尽管如此，如果没有这种戏剧感，

49
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:10,642
without this sense of theatre.
法国大革命就不会发生。

50
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:17,683
Its great orators, like Danton, were performers,
shamelessly playing to the gallery,
当时那些重要的演说家们，比如Danton，同时也是表演者，
毫不含糊地迎合大众趣味

51
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,645
milking the cheers and the hisses.
以榨取欢呼和嘘声

52
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:23,082
Reason fights on your side,
>> 理性站在你这一边！

53
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:27,763
and you have not even begun
to astonish the world.
>> 而你，尚未开始你震撼世界的征程！

54
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:32,438
And if they were really
going to create a new France,
而如果要创立一个全新的法兰西

55
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:36,202
they needed someone to create images
to go with the words.
他们就需要一个能够用画面阐释文字的人

56
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,163
That someone was Jacques-Louis David.
这个人就是雅克路易大卫

57
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:50,041
It was David who would give people
the vision of what a true citizen was.
是大卫给了大众理想公民的图景

58
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:56,923
His art, then, wasn't meant as gallery fodder.
It was an entire way of life.
因此，他的艺术本不是为了充实画廊，
而是一种全新的生活方式，

59
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,841
Or death.
或者死亡方式。

60
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:09,597
I'm not sure how I feel about this painting,
except deeply conflicted.
除了深深的冲突感，我不知道还能怎么描述我的感受。

61
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,921
Yes, it's tragically beautiful.
不错，它有着悲剧般的美感

62
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:18,718
But to say that is to separate it
from the appalling moment of its creation.
但是这样说，就完全抛开了可怕的创作背景。

63
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:25,920
This is Jean-Paul Marat,
the most paranoid of the Revolution's fanatics.
画中人是让-保尔马拉，大革命中最为偏执的狂热分子

64
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,481
He's been assassinated in his bath.
他在浴缸中被人刺杀

65
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:37,440
Marat was someone for whom there could
never be enough terror, never enough killing.
对马拉来说，手段多恐怖都不算什么，杀多少人都不够

66
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:42,846
But for David, Marat isn't a monster. He's a saint.
但在大卫看来，马拉不是杀人狂魔，而是圣徒。

67
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:48,325
This painting transforms Marat
into a paragon of virtue.
这幅油画把马拉变成了道德模范。

68
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,597
Breathtaking? For sure.
叹为观止？当然了

69
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:54,520
But maybe also just a little mad.
但是也有一点疯狂吧

70
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:05,276
Which isn't to say that Jacques-Louis David
was some sort of malevolent crackpot.
这倒不是说雅克路易大卫是恶毒的疯子

71
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:09,316
All his life, he was really only looking for virtue.
终其一生，大卫都在追求美德。

72
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:16,520
There was something painfully earnest
about him, resolute, self-contained.
他身上有些痛苦而真诚的特质，果断刚毅，自成一体。

73
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,524
One, two, three.
>> 一，二，三

74
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:24,325
Not surprising, really. When he was seven,
其实也不奇怪。七岁的时候

75
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:28,639
his father, an iron merchant,
had been killed in a pistol duel.
他的父亲，一个铁器商人，在一场手枪决斗中被杀

76
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:32,798
Something iron must have entered the boy's soul.
必定有些铁质的东西进入了小男孩的精神

77
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,239
He was looked after by friendly uncles
他由友好的叔叔们看管

78
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:44,846
who wanted him to be a lawyer or an architect,
but David would hear of nothing but painting.
叔叔们希望他能成为律师或者建筑设计师，
但是大卫除了油画什么都听不进去。

79
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:49,156
So the uncles sent him on to his mother's cousin,
所以叔叔们把他送到妈妈的的表亲那里

80
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,206
who just happened to be
the most successful painter in France.
这个表亲刚好是法国最成功的油画家，弗朗索瓦布歇

81
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:02,400
Francois Boucher knew exactly
what art was supposed to deliver for the nobility.
弗朗索瓦布歇最清楚贵族们想要什么样的艺术了

82
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,446
The pinkest, flossiest eye candy imaginable,
你能想到的最松软粉嫩的秀色佳人

83
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:11,281
rosy bums romping on frothy pillows.
颜色红润的闲汉与泡沫枕头嬉戏

84
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,796
But perhaps
Boucher saw in the sober, young David
但是或许，布歇从年轻而严肃的大卫身上看到了

85
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:29,119
someone for whom melting beauty
was not going to be the point of art.
一个不以柔美为艺术追求的人

86
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:32,355
So he sent him on to another master.
所以他把大卫送到了另一位大师门下。

87
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:36,201
But Boucher said to David,
''Come and see me from time to time,
但也对大卫说：”经常回来看看，

88
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:38,676
and I will teach you my warmth.''
我可以教你画出热情。“

89
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:48,076
But David would never be at home
in the pleasure industry. He was a loner.
但是大卫跟愉悦总是合不来，他总是独来独往。

90
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:53,082
Once he got involved in a swordfight,
and took a vicious slash on his cheek.
他有一次卷入了一场持剑争斗中，
脸上被狠狠划了一道

91
00:08:55,127 --> 00:09:01,475
The wound grew into a benign tumour.
That was the first thing anyone noticed about him.
伤口后来长成了一个良性肿瘤。
这成了他最显眼的标记

92
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:06,646
His enemies would call him,
''David with the swollen cheek. ''
他的对手们叫他，肿脸的大卫

93
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:21,482
Accidents like this happened every day.
Walk down any Paris street or into any salon,
这种事情在当时每天都有，
在巴黎，随便走在哪条街道，或者进入哪个沙龙，

94
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:25,401
and you would have seen a rich gallery
of the deformed and the disfigured.
都能看到形形色色的容貌毁损，

95
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:30,003
Terrible smallpox scars, club feet, harelips, the lot.
可怕的天花疤痕，畸形脚，兔唇，不一而足。

96
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:35,207
But some accidents matter to people
and some don't. This one did.
但是有些外伤对人无关紧要，有些很让人在意。
大卫就很在意自己的伤口。

97
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,526
David's disfigurement meant
he couldn't talk properly.
大卫这种破相意味着他无法正常说话。

98
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:52,001
Few people could understand what he was saying,
so he ended up not saying very much.
没人能明白他说的是什么，
所以他也就不怎么说话。

99
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:57,405
When he did talk, he was painfully conscious
of being a stammerer.
说话的时候，他痛苦而清醒地意识到自己的口吃。

100
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:12,755
If there was ever a moment in history
when wit and banter really mattered,
如果说在历史上有某个时间，机智和诙谐非常重要，

101
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,441
it was surely in 18th-century France.
那肯定就是18世纪的法国了。

102
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:22,246
But David of the swollen cheek couldn't talk,
he couldn't chat, he just mumbled.
而肿脸的大卫偏偏无法谈论，无法聊天，他只能咕哝。

103
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,563
Maybe there was one consolation,
或许还有一个安慰，

104
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:33,926
for there was someone else who was famous
for his handicaps in the wit department,
因为当时还有另外一个与机智无缘的知名人士，

105
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:36,237
and he happened to be the king.
就是当时的国王。

106
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:45,279
Louis XVI was born to worry about happiness.
路易十六生来就必须为幸福操心

107
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:51,647
His grandfather, Louis XV,
had designed Versailles around its pursuit.
他的祖父，路易十四，设计了凡尔赛宫。

108
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:56,562
But for his young successor,
happiness would always be hard work.
但他的继任者而言，幸福快乐很不容易。

109
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:08,920
When Louis came to the throne in 1775,
he wanted the best for everyone,
当路易于1775年即位时，他希望每个人都好，

110
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:12,360
but he just didn't know how to get it.
他就是不知道该怎么做

111
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:18,075
The saddest thing about Louis XVI
关于路易十六，最让人难过的是，

112
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:22,957
was that the king who went down in history
as the reactionary symbol of the old regime
这个以旧政权反动符号载入史册的国王，

113
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:28,804
actually thought of himself as thoroughly modern,
deeply into science and technology.
真诚地觉得自己非常现代，
对科学和技术非常感兴趣。

114
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,321
Balloons? Couldn't get enough of them.
气球？怎么也玩不够。

115
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:41,076
His reign, which ended in catastrophe,
began in a sunburst of giddy optimism,
他的政权，终于灾难，却始于朝阳般令人眩晕的乐观，

116
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,442
and a change in taste, too.
和审美口味的转变。

117
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:49,961
Out went gold ormolu,
in came modesty, the cult of nature.
金碧辉煌不再吃香，取而代之的是谦逊和对自然的崇拜

118
00:11:56,167 --> 00:12:02,242
Even Louis XVI's young Austrian queen,
Marie Antoinette, was a devotee.
连路易十六的奥地利王后，年轻的玛丽·安托瓦内特，
也是新口味的拥护者。

119
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:09,036
She built a toy farm here at Versailles,
went off milking cows in the royal dairy.
她在凡尔赛宫建了一个迷你农场，给皇家奶牛挤奶。

120
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:13,364
So, no more couches and courtesans.
所以，沙发和交际花了不再流行

121
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:16,757
Instead, tenderness, simplicity.
相反，要柔情，要简洁。

122
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:27,677
Tears were especially prized
as evidence of feeling.
泪水，作为情感的外显，尤其被珍视。

123
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,076
Paintings like this went down well.
像这种画作就很受欢迎。

124
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,479
Girl Weeping Over Dead Canary
by Jean-Baptiste Greuze.
让 - 巴蒂斯特·格勒兹的
“为死去的金丝雀哭泣的少女”

125
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,482
People wept when they saw it.
人们一边观看一边落泪。

126
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:49,082
Feelings mattered to David, too,
情感对于大卫也很重要，

127
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,445
but not the shallow kind
embraced by the fashionable elite.
但他所看重的可不是时尚精英们所崇尚的浅薄情感，

128
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:03,686
No, David was in search of something steelier.
大卫所寻求的，是更为钢劲的情感寄托。

129
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,883
It was amidst the stones of Rome that he found it.
他在罗马城的石头中发现了这种情感寄托，

130
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:17,600
Everything changed for David here.
Not just what he thought about art,
大卫的一切从此改变了，
不光是他对艺术的看法，

131
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:20,679
but what he thought
about the future of his country.
还有他对于国家前途的思索。

132
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,879
So what were the stones telling him?
那么，他从这些石头中得到了什么呢？

133
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:30,677
''This is what happens
to decadent empires, '' they said.
“帝国朽坏，这就是下场”，这些石头仿佛在说

134
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:35,002
Once there had been a free Rome, the Republic,
曾几何时，自由的罗马共和国，

135
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:39,922
austere, just, virile, packed with flinty heroes.
严肃，公正，阳刚，到处都是深邃的英雄人物，

136
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:44,406
But effeminate luxury had killed it.
而最后毁于骄奢淫逸，

137
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:50,161
Liberty had surrendered to despotism
and the Romans had become slaves.
自由屈服于专制，而罗马人变成了奴隶。

138
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:57,287
How that message from history
echoed in David's fertile brain.
这些来自历史深处的启示，
是如何在大卫那活跃的大脑里回响呢？

139
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,046
And in 1785, David delivered that message,
在1785年，大卫传达了这个启示，

140
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:09,996
like a package of bad news
for the complacent and the over-powdered.
给志得意满热衷粉饰者带来了坏消息。

141
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:16,366
Welcome to the first public art show in the world,
欢迎来到世界上第一次公共艺术展！

142
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:19,086
in the palace of the Louvre, no less.
展会位于卢浮宫，

143
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:22,318
This wasn't always a hushed museum.
这可不总是一个安静的博物馆，

144
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:28,721
Every two years, it staged the greatest
public entertainment in Paris, and it was free.
每过两年，巴黎最盛大的公共娱乐就会在这里上演，完全免费。

145
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:39,437
Word had got out
there was something sensational to see.
到处都在传说那里有轰动一时的东西可看，

146
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,364
Jacques-Louis David's Oath of the Horatii.
雅克路易大卫的“赫拉迪兄弟之誓”。

147
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:49,282
It's a painting about a country in crisis.
画的是身处危机的国家，

148
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:54,198
To avoid war,
the Romans have chosen three of their men
为避免战争，罗马人选了三个男人

149
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:58,803
to fight with three from the enemy.
Last one standing wins.
与三个敌人决斗，哪方的人最后活下来，就算哪方胜。

150
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:06,245
The cruel twist is that one of the Roman boys
is married to an enemy girl.
残酷的关键是，其中一个罗马男人已经与敌方的女子成婚。

151
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:11,364
Widowhood and orphanhood beckon.
要么守寡，要么成孤。

152
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:20,881
But none of the men
are paying the slightest attention to that.
但是，画面中的男人对此毫不在意

153
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:27,566
This is a boys' bonding picture,
a tight-packed display of muscle, veins and steel.
这是男孩子们心手相连的图景，
肌肉，静脉和钢刃紧贴在一起

154
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,682
The only splash of colour
is the blood red of that cape.
唯一的大片色彩，是血红色的斗篷。

155
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:42,085
The father solemnly swears them
to conquer or die,
画中的父亲赤手握着锋利的刀刃，

156
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,680
his naked hand on the sharp blade.
郑重地带他们起誓，要么征服，要么死去。

157
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:17,084
At least 60,000 people would have come
to the exhibition to see this painting,
至少6万人要去看展出的这幅画，

158
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:21,240
and not just the bigwigs either,
but shopkeepers, fishwives,
不仅是显要人物，从店主到渔妇，

159
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,921
the whole sweaty, growling public.
整个劳苦大众，

160
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,642
They would be David's people.
他们都是大卫的人民。

161
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:34,362
And they looked
at that strange line dance of death,
他们看着这种陌生的死亡之舞，

162
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:37,883
and they didn't know
whether to be thrilled or scared.
不知道该感到激动还是害怕，

163
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:46,765
It felt like a call to arms
in the face of a great crisis.
仿佛自己身处危机，被召唤入伍。

164
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:56,006
And that crisis was happening
not in ancient Rome, but here and now,
而危机不在古代罗马，而是就在当下，迫在眉睫，

165
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:58,317
in Louis XVI's France.
在路易十六的法兰西

166
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:05,922
It began, as so many revolutions do,
with a financial meltdown.
如同许许多多革命一样，它始于一场金融体系崩溃。

167
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:11,239
France had taken pride
in helping America to win independence,
帮助美国独立，法国一直引以为傲，

168
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:14,239
but it had come at a huge cost.
但是也为此付出沉重代价，

169
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:20,800
Avoiding bankruptcy meant more taxes.
要免于破产，就必须加税，

170
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:26,236
So, awkward questions were being asked
由此，尴尬的问题被提出来了：

171
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:30,366
about why the nobility and the clergy
were tax-exempt,
为什么贵族和神职人员可以免税，

172
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:34,281
while the scarecrow poor
were supposed to empty their pockets.
而穷人却必须掏空口袋？

173
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,726
Wasn't the nation all in it together?
不是该由整个国家来共同承受吗？

174
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:43,682
The nation? Well, that was a new idea.
整个国家？嗯，这可是个全新的想法。

175
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:47,885
And while we're at it,
how about elected representatives, too?
既然说到这儿了，是不是该讨论一下民选代表呢？

176
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:56,163
Oh, it went without saying
that the new France would still be a monarchy.
对了，不用说，新法兰西仍然会是君主政体。

177
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:00,244
The queen, with all those diamonds,
needed putting in her place,
王后，有那么多钻石了，应该知趣。

178
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:02,602
but the king was a good fellow.
不过国王人还不错。

179
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:09,763
No reason to assume a social apocalypse
around the corner.
也没有理由担心什么近在眼前的社会灾难。

180
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:28,685
For a while, that's how David himself felt,
which didn't mean a little reform wouldn't help.
有一段时间，大卫也是这么感觉的。
但这不是说一点改革都不需要。

181
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,837
There was a lot of deadwood around.
到处都是衰朽之士，

182
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:36,604
For a start, those non-entities
at the Academy of Painting, they'd have to go.
最起码，绘画学院的那些老朽们，必须滚蛋。

183
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:41,638
When he was a struggling artist,
they'd rejected him four times.
大卫出名之前，被他们拒过四次。

184
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:45,515
Now he was successful, 
they barely tolerated him.
现在他成功了，他们勉强容忍他。

185
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:50,317
Well, their time was up.
Anyway, he didn't need them any more.
好了，现在没他们什么事了。
不管怎么说，他也用不着他们。

186
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:53,604
Now he had intelligent, liberal-minded followers.
现在他有自己聪敏开明的追随者。

187
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:08,315
Here are two of those good eggs,
rich, smart and affable.
这两位就在其中的佼佼者。
富有，聪明，和蔼可亲

188
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:13,401
Mr and Mrs Charming,
Antoine and Marie-Anne Lavoisier.

189
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,887
He is a famous experimental chemist.

190
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:21,036
That flask on the floor is for measuring gases.
地板上的烧瓶是用来测量气体的。

191
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:26,686
Marie-Anne, who'd married him at 13,
was more than a wife.
女士玛丽安，于13岁嫁给安东尼拉瓦锡。她不仅仅是妻子，

192
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:31,883
That casual hand on his shoulder
tells us she was a true partner,
随意放在他肩头的手，向我们显示她是一个真正的伴侣，

193
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:38,045
translating articles from English for him,
designing illustrations for his books.
她为丈夫翻译英文文章，为他的书设计插画。

194
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:46,719
He's filthy rich,
but he does have a social conscience.
先生财大气粗，却不乏社会良知，

195
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:50,436
A lot of his money
has been put into draining swamps
把很多钱花在排干沼泽

196
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:53,599
to eradicate malaria, that sort of thing.
以根除疟疾等事情上。

197
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:59,722
To look at the portrait,
you'd think David has captured a vision
看着这幅画像，你会觉得大卫捕捉到了一个愿景。

198
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:03,277
of the kind of people
who ought to be governing France,
正该是像这样人性化，深情而又现代的人

199
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,440
humane, affectionate and modern.
来治理法国。

200
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:13,443
Well, for 7,000 livres, he wasn't even
going to hint at the other Lavoisier,
当然了，为了7000里弗尔，
他才不会去提及拉瓦锡的另一面，

201
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:18,403
the one who made money
collecting taxes with the help of a private army.
那个使用私人军队收税而大赚特赚的拉瓦锡。

202
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:25,477
No, David took his fee, but when the time came
for him to show the painting at the Louvre,
大卫收了他的钱，但是到了要在卢浮宫展示这幅画作的时候，

203
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:30,243
he ended up withdrawing it.
But then he would, wouldn't he?
大卫却把这幅画抽出来了。肯定会这样的，不是吗？

204
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:36,879
Between the paint drying and the show opening,
everything in France had changed.
就在油画尚未晾干，展会开幕之前的一段时间里，
法国的一切都变了。

205
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:39,884

from thousands of meetings all over France.

at the worst possible time.

210

Harvest wipeouts, soaring prices.

211
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,966
Put hope and desperation together,
and what do you get?
把希望遇到绝望，得到什么？

212
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:22,959
The political equivalent of nitroglycerine.
政治上的硝化甘油

213
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:35,004
When the Estate's General met here 
in Versailles, in the spring of 1789,
当三级会议于1789年春在凡尔赛集会时，

214
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:40,396

217
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:52,917
and for the first time come together
as a single national assembly?
破天荒坐到一起开一个全国大会？

218
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,646
The commoners, among them
a young lawyer, Maximilien Robespierre,
平民代表中，一个叫罗伯斯庇尔的年轻律师，

219
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:02,001
forced the issue,

1789年6月20日，

224
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:28,359
and it's one of those
late-spring torrential downpours.
在暮春的瓢泼大雨中

225
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,679
And the 600 deputies of the Third Estate,
the commoners,

226
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:36,123
plus their new allies
among the nobles and the clergy,

have been locked out of their meeting hall.

knows a tennis court quite close by.

without the king's permission.

00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:23,480
Arms stretch, bodies embrace,
life had caught up with art.

David's Rome reborn was the new France.
大卫的罗马重生在新法兰西。

236
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:41,516
A year later, David got to work
on his depiction of the Tennis Court Oath.
一年之后，大卫开始绘制“网球厅宣誓”

It's a picture filled with noise.

238
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:49,844

241
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:07,680
Except it's not empty at all.
不过并不空虚

242
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:13,364
It's filled with light and rushing wind,
the furious energy of liberty.

243
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:15,639
It's an idea.
这是一种信念

244
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:20,164
An idea so big, it dwarfs the humans who enact it.
这信念如此宏大，投身其中的人显得微不足道。

245
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:41,086
The drawing was supposed to be
turned into a huge painting.
绘画应该变成一幅巨大的油画。

246
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:46,958
This is just a small section of it.

这里只是一种一小部分

Before David even had a chance
to put clothes on these nude models,

248
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:54,758
many of them would be dead or disgraced.
很多在现实中已经死去，或者声名狼藉

249
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:03,886
The great message of unity and freedom
would soon be quaintly out of date.
团结和自由的启示很快会变得过时

250
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:10,206
Instead of arms outstretched,
there was an epidemic of finger-pointing.
伸展的手臂，被相互指责所取代

251
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:20,717
July 1789 ought to have been a moment
of golden optimism for the reborn France.
1789年7月必定是新法兰西历史上最乐观的时刻。

the results of the Tennis Court Oath,

nobody actually believed him.

the fortress of the Bastille with gunpowder,
有人说国王在巴士底狱的城堡里秘密囤积了火药

257
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:47,277
so Paris was literally
a powder keg waiting to happen.
所以巴黎就是一个等待爆炸的火药桶

258

On the morning of July 14th, a crowd

259

there's a first shot. No one knows from where.

were going to be bloodless?
不过，谁说过革命会不流血呢？

Here's David's contribution
to the decapitation campaign.

and he literally doesn't look back.
人们把无头的尸体抬给他，而他就是不回头看。

272
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:40,397
Only that right foot
is a sign of his repressed emotion.

如同所有大卫的重要作品一样，这幅画有些地方让人心生寒意

your blood runs cold at what it's saying.
即使在你惊奇于它的绝妙之处的时候，

278
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,845
Look what's at the dead centre of the picture,
看看画面的中央是什么

a pair of sharp scissors,
the hard, cold metal that's cut the family ties.

spasms of vindictive lynching.
从狂喜的公开拥抱，

Why the anger? Because people were still hungry.

286
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:48,405

out of the safety of Versailles, to Paris.

an odd mix of dogma and uncertainty.

00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:03,399
Did the Friend of the People
ever rest from his patriotic toil?
这位人民之友，可曾在爱国辛劳中休息片刻？

381
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:13,165
The next day, Charlotte Corday walked over
to Marat's house on the rue des Cordeliers.
第二天，夏洛特科迪走过马拉在Cordeliers大街上的住宅。

382
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:18,958
Barred at the door, she tried delivering
a handwritten note warning him about plots,
被拦在门外，她试图把一个手写的字条交给他，让他警惕一些阴谋，

383
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:23,245
hoping he was gonna rise to the bait. No reply.
希望他能够上钩。但是没有得到回应。

384
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:29,520
That evening, she tried again.
当天晚上，她再次做出尝试。

385
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:35,077
As she arrived, two men were delivering
bread and newspapers.
她到的时候，有两个人在送面包和报纸。

386
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,078
She was in.
她进去了。

387
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:46,559
Corday pretended she was an informer
and gave Marat a list of traitors.
科迪假装是线人，给了马拉一份叛徒的名单。

388
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:51,483
''I will have them guillotined in a week'', he said.
“一周之内，我就把他们送上断头台“，他说。

389
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:56,358
And that was it.
就这样，

390
00:40:57,167 --> 00:41:01,922
Out came the knife, straight into Marat's chest.
亮出匕首，直插入马拉的胸膛。

391
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:16,204
So the Friend of the People
was lost to the Revolution.
就这样人民的朋友亡于革命。

392
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:21,921
Inside the National Convention,
grief-stricken deputies cried their eyes out,
在国民大会中，悲痛欲绝的代表们恨不得把眼珠子哭出来，

393
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:23,918
authentically or not.
真假难辨。

394
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:28,878
What they most wanted, I think,
was for Marat to come back to them.
他们最希望的，我认为，是马拉能够活过来。

395
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:33,722
''Come back, come back.
We need you, all of France needs you.''
回来吧，回来吧，我们需要你，整个法国需要你。

396
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:40,516
And then one of the most theatrical deputies
rose to his feet and shouted,
然后一个最戏剧化的代表站了起来大声喊道：

397
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:45,198
''David, where are you?
There is one more job for you.''
“大卫，你在哪儿呢？这里有份工作交给你。“

398
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:54,562
And David of the swollen cheek
miraculously found his voice.
肿脸颊大卫奇迹般地找回了自己的声音。

399
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:56,202
I shall do it.
我一定

400
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:57,925
''I shall do it, ''he said.
“我一定“，他说。

401
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:02,282
''I will paint Marat. ''
我会把马拉画下来。

402
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:21,515
It was midsummer,
the hottest in anyone's memory.
正值仲夏，所有人的记忆中最热的一回。

403
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:29,238
The embalmers, under David's direction,
were working overtime,
防腐师们，在大卫的指导下，加班加点

404
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:32,160
preparing Marat's body for the funeral.
把马拉的尸体做葬礼准备。

405
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:38,282
But his normally ghastly red-flesh colour
was rapidly turning green.
但是他平时那可怕的肉红色正迅速变绿。

406
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:49,277
David had wanted Marat displayed sitting upright,
working for the good of the people.
大卫本希望马拉能够坐正，展示为人民不辞辛劳的样子，

407
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,721
But the decomposing corpse
refused to co-operate.
但是快速分解的尸体不肯配合。

408
00:42:54,847 --> 00:43:01,320
Drenched in perfume, it had to be laid flat out
for the grieving public to file past.
尸身浸透了香水，只能平放着，让悲伤的群众绕过。

409
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:21,526
The funeral would inevitably fade
in people's memory.
葬礼会不可避免地从人们的记忆中消退，

410
00:43:22,087 --> 00:43:24,885
The painting, though, would never fade.
而画作，将永远留存。

411
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:33,686
It was Marat's best revenge,
它简直是马拉最好的报复，

412
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:37,840
for it would make sure
that he would always be around.
他因为这幅画而永远伴随着我们。

413
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:50,520
Here was someone transfigured by goodness,
honesty and patriotic selflessness.
画面上是一个善良、诚实和无私的爱国精神的化身。

414
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:57,638
''Look upon him,'' David is saying,
''And you will see the highest type of humanity.''
“看着他，“大卫仿佛在说，”你就会看到人性的最高形式。“

415
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,597
He's cleaned Marat up, of course.
自然，大卫也把马拉的身体清理得很干净。

416
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:17,282
The skin has the colour of cool stone,
皮肤是冰冷的石头色，

417
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:24,045
the wound is unmissable,
yet at the same time almost delicate,
伤口非常明显，同时又有点太精致了，

418
00:44:24,127 --> 00:44:27,836
like the incision in the side of Christ on the cross.
仿佛十字架上基督的伤口。

419
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:34,439
The white sheets seem shroud-like,
白色的床单看起来像裹尸布，

420
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:40,523
ghostly wrappings of the great man
as he hovers between our world and posterity.
朦胧地包裹着这位大人物，使他漂浮于现世与后世之间。

421
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:49,320
It's a cult image,
这是一幅邪典图画，

422
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:52,240
and it tells you to believe.
要求你要相信它。

423
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:05,080
Its genius lies in the fact
that it's also a story for the people.
其天才之处在于，这同时又是一个人民的故事。

424
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:08,637
For once, the hero isn't Roman, he's one of them.
这一回，英雄人物并非罗马人，而是他们中的一员。

425
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:12,083
It's the first great work for the faces in the crowd,
这是群众面孔的第一幅重要作品，

426
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,601
the singers of the Marseillaise.
唱着马赛曲的群众。

427
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:20,159
You can almost feel David
imagining whole families in front of this painting,
几乎可以想见大卫如何想象一家人站在画作前面，

428
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:24,718
a father saying to his children,
''Look, there's his inkwell."
父亲对孩子们说，“看，这是他的墨水瓶。“

429
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:31,121
''Look, there's the letter of the wicked Corday,
stained with the blood of the good Marat.''
“看，这里是那个邪恶的科迪的信，上面还沾着善良的马拉的血。“

430
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:40,647
But David is not showing the letter
that got Corday into Marat's house,
只不过，大卫并没有展示那封使科迪进入马拉家的，

431
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:42,957
the one with the list of traitors.
上面列出叛徒名字的信。

432
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,085
It's a different letter.
这是另外一封信。

433
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:49,445
One that would make Marat seem
like a victim of his own kindness.
这封信让马拉似乎因为自己的善良而受害。

434
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:57,435
''It's enough that I am truly unhappy
to have the right to your benevolence, '' it says.
“这样受恩于您，我真的很不开心。这就够了“，上面写着。

435
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:05,642
On top of the box is another letter,
from the widow of a soldier fallen in battle.
在盒子上还有另外一封信，来自阵亡战士的遗孀，

436
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:09,925
With it is a donation Marat is about to send her.
旁边使马拉准备捐给她的钱。

437
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:15,479
Two women, then,
the good mother and the bad Corday.
两位女性，一个好妈妈，一个坏科迪。

438
00:46:18,727 --> 00:46:22,242
There's no attempt
to give a sense of Marat's room here.
作品完全没有尝试描绘马拉的房间。

439
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:26,679
No crossed pistols hanging on the wall,
no fake columns.
墙上没有交叉的手枪，也没有假柱子。

440
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:33,643
Instead, the entire top half of the painting
is filled with loose, feathery strokes
取而代之的是，充满画面整个上半部分的松散的羽毛笔触，

441
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,845
that could be wall or just indeterminate space.
可能是墙，也可能是不确定的虚空，

442
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:41,877
The space of forever.
永恒的空间。

443
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:52,800
But then that box, grainy, solid.
但是还有那个盒子，粗糙而坚固。

444
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:59,765
''He was one of you, '' the box says.
''One of the poor and suffering.
“他是你们的一员“，盒子在诉说，”跟你们一样穷困，跟你们受苦。“

445
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:04,998
''But now you can't reach him.
“如今你再也见不到他了。

446
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:09,126
''No one can, except through this. ''
“谁都见不到，除了在这里。”

447
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:18,286
But even while you're held spellbound,
但即使你被迷住，

448
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:21,757
another voice inside your head says,
''Hold on a minute,"
还有另外一个声音在耳边说，“等一下，”

449
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:24,281
''this is the purest witchcraft.''
“这是彻头彻尾的巫术”

450
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:28,963
What David has done here is to glorify a paranoid,
“大卫这是在美化一个偏执狂，

451
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:33,484
whose greatest satisfaction
was the persecution of thousands of people
“这家伙最大的满足是对成千上万人进行迫害“

452
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:38,482
whose only crime was to be lukewarm
about politics.
“而他们唯一的罪过，不过是对政治不冷不热“

453
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:41,639
This is an accomplice of terror.
“这是与恐怖的共谋“

454
00:48:01,247 --> 00:48:05,923
Of course, it never occurred to David
that he was betraying art.
当然，大卫从来没有想过自己是在背叛艺术。

455
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:11,035
''Oh, no,'' he would have said.
''I'm fulfilling its highest, noblest purpose,"
“哦，不对。“他会说，”我是在实现艺术的最崇高的目标：“

456
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:14,280
''that of moral re-education."
“道德教化“

457
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:24,485
''That's what all those altarpieces
that once hung in churches did,"
“正如教堂的圣坛上悬挂的那些作品一样，“

458
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:29,598
''but those were all lies and fairytales."
“只不过他们画的都是谎言和神话。“

459
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:37,878
''We have a new church now,
the church of revolutionary virtue. ''
“而我们现在有了新的教堂，革命精神的教堂。“

460
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:45,001
So why do I like David?
所以，我为什么喜欢大卫？

461
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:47,806
Well, I don't. He's a monster.
实际上，我不喜欢，他就是个怪物。

462
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:51,436
But he makes ideas blaze in dry ice.
他能够让信念在干冰中燃烧。

463
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:55,839
He is a fantastic propagandist, no one better.
他是一个超级宣传员，无人超越。

464
00:48:55,927 --> 00:48:59,840
Albert Speer could just as well roll over and die.
Albert Speer也只能瞠乎其后。
465
00:49:03,647 --> 00:49:05,797
And what was the point of it all?
那么这些又有什么意义呢？

466
00:49:05,887 --> 00:49:10,677
Well, it's a revenge on wit, on chat and on banter.
我想，这是对机敏、巧言和戏谑的回击。

467
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:14,078
But it was more than that.
还不止于此。

468
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:19,321
This is art designed
to make those who saw it virtuous citizens.
这是一种将观赏者塑造为高尚公民的艺术。

469
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:29,280
And it's all so perfect, so tragic,
so poetic you almost believe it.
而它又如此完美，如此富于悲剧色彩，如此诗意，你几乎要相信它了。

470
00:49:31,487 --> 00:49:35,526
But like a lot of art designed to improve humanity,
但正如很多致力于提高人性的艺术一样，

471
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:37,882
it has the opposite effect.
它起到了相反的效果。

472
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:42,836
Because it's a lie.
因为它本来就是谎言。

473
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:03,964
Three months after the assassination of Marat,
马拉遇刺三个月之后，

474
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:09,758
on October 16th, 1793,
Marie Antoinette went to the guillotine.
1793年10月16日，玛丽安特瓦奈特被押去断头台。

475
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:14,397
David saw her tumbrel going down the street,
大卫看到她的囚车在街上走，

476
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:16,802
while people spat in their hands
人们摩拳擦掌

477
00:50:16,887 --> 00:50:21,483
and tried to throw the gobs
on the woman who'd been queen.
争相往他们曾经的王后身上扔东西。

478
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:24,921
He sketched her impassively.
他描绘了她的形象，内心无动于衷。

479
00:50:31,847 --> 00:50:37,319
But David's got more important things on his mind
than the fate of Marie Antoinette.
在大卫心中有比玛丽安特瓦奈特的命运更重要的事情。

480
00:50:37,407 --> 00:50:41,798
He's now the official director
of revolutionary propaganda,
他现在是正式的革命宣传主管

481
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:45,882
to the exclusion of practically everything else.
其它任何事情都无需关心。

482
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:52,444
When his wife disapproved of his zeal,
he divorced her.
当他的妻子不赞成他的热诚时，他跟她离婚了。

483
00:50:56,367 --> 00:51:01,919
David has become an enforcer,
sitting on the Committee for General Security,
大卫成了执法者，是总体安全委员会的成员。

484
00:51:02,007 --> 00:51:07,843
hunting down the treacherously half-hearted,
signing warrants for their execution.
忙于追捕那些三心二意的背叛者，签署他们的处决令。

485
00:51:24,087 --> 00:51:26,203
The terror had begun,
恐怖已然开始，

486
00:51:26,287 --> 00:51:30,724
and David had become part
of the great engine of killing.
大卫成了绞肉机的一部分。

487
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:37,881
And as the tempo of the guillotine got faster,
随着断头台的鼓点越催越快，

488
00:51:38,247 --> 00:51:44,482
David busied himself with ever more
extravagant spectacles to educate the people.
大卫忙于用越来越夸张的奇观来教育民众。

489
00:51:46,247 --> 00:51:52,516
Casts of thousands, massed singing virgins,
statues on the site of the Bastille.
几千人出场，成群唱歌的处女，巴士底上方的雕像，

490
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:57,123
A festival of the supreme being,
至高级别的欢庆，

491
00:51:57,207 --> 00:52:02,281
starring the high priest of the Revolution,
Maximilien Robespierre.
主演是大革命的祭司，马克西米连罗伯斯比尔。

492
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:10,206
In the end, David was a victim of his own success.
最终，大卫成了他自己成功的牺牲品。

493
00:52:10,287 --> 00:52:14,997
The hard-nosed men who were running the war
knew that bread and guns mattered,
负责战争的强硬人物清楚，跟面包和枪炮相比，

494
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:17,601
and virgins and doves didn't.
处女和鸽子没那么重要。

495
00:52:17,687 --> 00:52:22,317
So David wasn't just a distraction,
he was a menace. Get rid of him.
所以大卫不仅分散注意力，还是一个威胁。赶走他！

496
00:52:25,927 --> 00:52:31,399
And David's downfall
was inextricably linked to the fate of Robespierre.
大卫的垮台与罗伯斯庇尔的命运密不可分。

497
00:52:32,367 --> 00:52:35,086
Increasingly, Robespierre was spoken of
罗伯斯庇尔越来越经常被视为暴君，

498
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:39,445
not as saviour of the Revolution, but tyrant,
而不再是革命的救世主。

499
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:45,159
and David, the window-dresser of his tyranny,
was going down with him.
而大卫，罗伯斯庇尔的妆点师，必须跟他一起走人。

500
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:52,960
Robespierre was attacked in the Convention,
the dreaded words ''outside the law'' uttered.
罗伯斯庇尔在国民大会受到攻击，有人说出了“违法“这样吓人的词汇。

501
00:52:55,087 --> 00:52:59,239
Incredulous, David made a spectacle of himself.
难以置信的是，大卫在此时展示了自己。

502
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:01,238
''Robespierre,'' he shouted.
“罗伯斯庇尔“，他喊道。

503
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:05,036
''If you drink the hemlock, I will drink it with you. ''
“如果你喝毒药，我就跟你一块儿喝“

504
00:53:08,327 --> 00:53:10,204
But of course, he didn't.
不过，他当然没有一块儿喝。

505
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:17,200
The next day, David was suddenly indisposed,
so he missed his own date with martyrdom.
第二天，大卫突然身体不适，错过了殉道的时机。

506
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:20,836
He was not there beside Robespierre
when he was guillotined
罗伯斯庇尔上断头台的时候，

507
00:53:20,927 --> 00:53:24,283
and the blade at last came down on the terror.
刀刃终于落在恐怖统治者头上的时候，大卫不在他的旁边。

508
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:27,645
But they came for David, nonetheless.
但大卫最终也没有逃过去。

509
00:53:31,847 --> 00:53:37,399
Vilified as tyrant of the arts,
David tried to stammer a defence.
被诋为艺术的暴君，大卫结结巴巴地为自己辩护。

510
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:43,764
No one could understand what he was saying,
but they noticed how pale he was,
没人听得懂他说的话，但人们注意到他面色苍白，

511
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:49,756
how the sweat ran through his clothes
and dripped onto the floor.
汗水渗透衣服，滴落在地上。

512
00:53:54,967 --> 00:54:00,644
In prison, he managed to get hold of some paints
and he painted this self-portrait.
在监狱里，他设法弄到了一些颜料，给自己花了这幅自画像。

513
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:07,560
You can see the famous tumour
and the twist it gives to his face,
可以看到那个知名的肿瘤，和他脸上的扭曲，

514
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:10,605
but that's as far as the truth goes.
但是忠于事实的部分到此为止。

515
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:16,083
Because what we're seeing
is not the old propaganda master, that's for sure,
因为我们看到的，肯定不是那个老年的宣传大师

516
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:20,115
but young David, 20 years at least taken off,
而是大卫年轻时候的样子，至少年轻了20岁，

517
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:24,926
all innocent, hair romantically dishevelled,
单纯透顶，头发漫卷，

518
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:30,561
coat open to expose his pure, transparent heart.
外套敞开，露出纯洁、清澈的内心。

519
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:35,876
And he's done himself with palette and brushes.
他用画笔和调色板成就了自己。

520
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:38,678
''Why me?'' it says.
“为什么惩罚我？“它问。

521
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:40,439
''I'm just a painter. ''
“我只是个画家“

522
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:48,963
Yeah, right.
好吧，没错。

523
00:54:49,047 --> 00:54:52,562
Led astray, were you? Just doing your job?
误入歧途，对吗？你只是在做自己的工作？

524
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:54,524
I don't think so.
少来了。

525
00:54:59,487 --> 00:55:03,480
But guess what? The art plea worked.
但你猜怎么着？艺术请求奏效了。

526
00:55:04,087 --> 00:55:05,839
David got out of prison,
大卫出狱了，

527
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:12,321
and spent the next years doing spectacular,
uncontroversial portraits like this.
在接下来的岁月里创作这样壮观的，毫无争议的肖像画。

528
00:55:13,327 --> 00:55:16,444
Monsieur Seriziat, his brother-in-law.
赛力齐亚特先生，他的姐夫。

529
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:22,398
This is what the Revolution of the virtuous
had become,
这就是高尚革命的结果，


530
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:27,563
the Republican tricolour
reduced to a fashion accessory.
共和国的三色旗沦为时尚装饰。

531
00:55:29,447 --> 00:55:33,599
When he does do history paintings,
they're pleas to stop killing.
再画历史事件的时候，他们展现的都是制止杀戮的情景。

532
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:39,483
No more politics, then,
for Jacques-Louis David, right?
雅克路易大卫再不涉及政治了，是吗？

533
00:55:48,287 --> 00:55:49,879
Wrong.
不对

534
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:52,765
The old demon never really goes away.
老恶魔永远不会真正消失。

535
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:57,237
Once bitten by power, you stay bitten.
被权力咬伤过一次，就永远被咬伤。

536
00:55:57,727 --> 00:56:03,882
He airbrushed Marat,
why shouldn't he airbrush Napoleon?
他能够粉饰马拉，为什么不能粉饰拿破仑？

537
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:18,126
When Napoleon was crowned emperor in 1805,
拿破仑在1805年加冕为皇帝的时候，

538
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:23,156
David was slavishly at his side, official glamoriser.
大卫忠实地站在旁边，他是官方的

539
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:29,843
But then, of course, Napoleon was defeated,
the monarchy restored.
当然，后来，拿破仑被打败了。王室又恢复了。
540
00:56:31,407 --> 00:56:34,160
Lots of Napoleon-lovers were forgiven,
很多拿破仑的追随者都被原谅了，

541
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:38,364
but not David.
但是其中不包括大卫。

542
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:45,396
He'd done something that could never be forgiven.

543
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:50,201
He'd done this,

544
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:54,121
the most notorious image produced by the terror.
恐怖统治下产生的最臭名昭著的形象。

545
00:56:59,687 --> 00:57:03,600
France had had enough of Jacques-Louis David.
法国受够了雅克路易大卫。

546
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:14,083
Banished from his own country,
David ended up here in Brussels,
被驱逐出自己的国家，大卫最终来到布鲁塞尔这里，

547
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:18,877
where he did paintings
of increasingly high-gloss weirdness,
在这里他画了一些越来越高光泽的怪异作品。

548
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:22,118
a big fish in a very small pond.
才华无处施展。

549
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:26,886
In France, they mostly talked about him
as a back number,
在法国，人们主要把他作为过期杂志谈起，

550
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:30,676
''Oh, David, Brutus and all that. Isn't he dead?''
“哦，大卫，画过布鲁图斯等等那个。他死了吗？“

551
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:37,197
When he did die, in December, 1825,
当他在1825年十二月去世的时候，

552
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:42,645
the government in Paris refused permission
for his family to bring the body home.
巴黎的政府拒绝许可其家人将遗体带回家。

553
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:45,916
No king-killers allowed.

554
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:53,601
David's paintings, though, were up for sale.
但是大卫的画，还在出售。

555
00:57:53,687 --> 00:58:00,081
Before that, they were put on public display.
Not, however, the notorious Marat.
之前，他们就可以公开展出，当然，除了臭名昭著的马拉之死。

556
00:58:01,887 --> 00:58:05,721
That was kept under guard
at the artist's son's house.
马拉之死被保管在大卫儿子的房子里。

557
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:09,199
Admission by private arrangement.

558
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,997
And you take a look at it and you know why.
看一眼就明白为什么了。

559
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:21,756
If ever there was a work of art
that says that beauty can be lethal,
如果说真有意见艺术品展示了美可以致命，

560
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:26,036
it's Jacques-Louis David's Death of Marat.
那就是雅克路易大卫的马拉之死。
